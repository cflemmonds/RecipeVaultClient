# Description

This app aims to settle the score between two age-old rivals, once and for all: Cooking at home vs ordering takeout.

The target audience is fairly broad. If you can flip a pancake, then this app is for you. It’s for college students on a limited budget who can only afford to buy grocery essentials. It’s for busy, career-focused individuals who barely have time to figure out how they will meet the next project deadline, let alone what to eat before hunger strikes again. 

Users can enter in their ingredients at home, and based on the ingredients entered into their pantry, it will give suggestions on what they can make. It will compare the ingredients entered to a list of recipes entered.

In future updates, the app will include functionality of Spoonacular API for additional support and recipes outside of the user-created recipes.

# Usage

Current build includes a log of food items, as well as recipes, and a table for storing and displaying the data.

Users can register for an account with first name, last name, unique email address and unique password; login only requires username and password.

Once logged in, users can create a list of ingredients with inputs for meat, veggies, spices etc.

Users can also switch over to their recipe log by clicking the MyVault button. This page includes inputs for the recipe name and meal time (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, brunch, etc).
